# Insertion Sort
## Algorithm
The simple steps of achieving the insertion sort are listed as follows -

1. Assume that, the element is the first element is already sorted.
2. Start picking the next elements using a loop, and store it separately in a key(temp).
3. Now, compare the key with all elements in the sorted array part using a nested loop.
4. If the element in the sorted array is smaller than the current element, then move to the next element. Else, shift greater elements in the array towards the right.
5. Insert the key value.
6. At the end of loop the array will be sorted.
7. Display the sorted array.
