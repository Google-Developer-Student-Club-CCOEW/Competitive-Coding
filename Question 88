/*Alice and Bob are ready to play a new game. Both the players take alternate turns. Alice starts first.

There are N binary numbers written on a blackboard.

Alice, in her turn, erases any 2 numbers from the blackboard and writes the bitwise OR of those 2 numbers on the blackboard.
Bob, in his turn, erases any 2 numbers from the blackboard and writes the bitwise AND of those 2 numbers on the blackboard.
Note that, after each move, the count of numbers written on the blackboard reduces by 1.
