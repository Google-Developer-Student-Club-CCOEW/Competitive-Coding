The main aim of competitive programming is to write code solve given problems. The problems are generally mathematical or logical nature and require comprehensive knowledge of data structures, geometry, number theory and graph theory to name a few. Problems related to Artificial Intelligence and Code golf are also popular nowadays. 

_It’s called “competitive” coding but most people get involved only to improve their own coding skills or just for the thrill of it_.

This repository contains variours competative programming questions and code solutions to them. You can contribute by adding solutions to them... comment in the issue you want to code for. Follow the Steps below to contribute!

### Search Issue -> Comment -> Get Assigned -> Create fork -> solve -> Create a pull request !!!
(detailed steps are given below)
## Contributing to this Repo

**1.** Fork [this](https://github.com/Google-Developer-Student-Club-CCOEW/Competitive-Coding/fork) repository.

**2.** Clone the forked repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/project_name.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd Competitive-Coding
```

**4.** Creating a new branch (IMP)
This is one of the very important step that you should follow to contribute in Open Source. A branch helps to manage the workflow, isolate your code and does not creates a mess. To create a new branch:

```bash
$ git branch <name_of_branch>
$ git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
```

Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

```bash
git pull origin main
```

**5.** Make changes in source code.

**6.** Stage your changes and commit

```bash
# Add changes to Index
git add .

# Commit to the local repo
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

**7.** At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**8.** Create a [Pull Request/PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) !

**9.** **Congratulations!** Sit and relax, you've made your contribution to Competitve Coding repository of GDSC Cummins.
